## 🖊️ Intro

This is a UI widget for Assetto Corsa for visualizing the gear ratios of the car on the setup screen.

It can either show the speed in metric or imperial units, and it can also adjust the graph to show the ideal shifting points for each gear (based on the engine's power curve).

## 🖥️ Installation

This mod requires [***Content Manager***](https://assettocorsa.club/content-manager.html) and [***Custom Shaders Patch***](https://acstuff.ru/patch/) to be installed!

First, download the latest version from [***Releases***](https://github.com/adam10603/AC-Gear-Ratio-Display/releases) or from [***RaceDepartment***](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/gear-ratio-display.67477/). After that you can simply drag and drop the .zip file into Content Manager to install it.

Once installed, it will automatically appear on the setup screen, just like this:
